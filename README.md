### 🧠 About Me

I build systems that **work** — industrial, electronic, digital, or philosophical.  
From PLCs on factory floors to Python scripts on Raspberry Pis:  

- **Industrial Automation Technician** — Smucker’s Uncrustables / former Leprino Foods / Cargill  
- **Hobbyist Engineer** — circuits, sensors, relays, CAN-bus, hydroponics, 3D printing  
- **Programmer** — Python, CircuitPython, Arduino, Linux automation, Raspberry Pi clusters  
- **Objectivist** — pro-reason, pro-capitalism, anti-bullshit  
- **Metalhead** — Metallica | Gojira | Slayer | Pantera | Machine Head
