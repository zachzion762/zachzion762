### About Me

I build systems that **work** — industrial, electronic, digital, or philosophical.  
From PLCs on factory floors to Python scripts on Raspberry Pis:  

- **Industrial Automation Technician** — Smucker’s Uncrustables / Leprino Foods / Cargill One Protein  
- **Hobbyist Engineer** — circuits, sensors, relays, CAN-bus, hydroponics, 3D printing  
- **Programmer** — Python, CircuitPython, Arduino, Linux automation, Raspberry Pi clusters  
- **Objectivist** — pro-reason, pro-capitalism, anti-bullshit  
- **Metalhead** — Metallica | Gojira | Slayer | Pantera | Machine Head | Sepultura

### My Projects

#### PepperCAN
A modular **CAN-bus hydroponic control network** — sensor nodes, relays, and displays tied together by a RP2040 controller.
- Features: pH / Temp / EC telemetry, automatic nutrient dosing, MQTT + Home Assistant integration
- Stack: CircuitPython, CAN, I²C multiplexer, Qualia displays, Docker HA bridge

#### Home Server Ecosystem
Self-hosted architecture running:
- Pi-hole + Unbound DNS
- Tailscale VPN
- Navidrome music server
- Home Assistant dashboards
- MQTT broker + automation scripts
- rclone + RAID NAS backups

#### DIY & Metal Projects
- Custom aluminum + brass casting  
- Vacuum tube preamps and audio PCB design  
- Reloading & precision shooting gear — sub-½" groups at 100 yards
